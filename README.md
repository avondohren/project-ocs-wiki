##Project for Omaha Code School Project

Created by Cara Heacock, Andy von Dohren, and Matt Hova

This is a fork from our main repository that we built on Cara's account.

This project was created as an open source Wiki platform. It was specifically created to house information related to
Omaha Code School.

Any user can view any article without having to register for an account.

Registered users can view, create, or edit any article. Users are verified by sending a confirmation email to the user before activating their account.

Admins have the capability to "freeze" an article, roll-back an article to a previous state, or ban a user from the wiki.
